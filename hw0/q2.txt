At the end of the semester, you will carry out a final project, which focuses on a molecular system of your own choosing.
Write a sentence or two describing (a) your scientific interests within chemistry,and (b) a molecular system you might
like to explore in your final project.  (There will be plenty of time to refine or change this proposed topic.)

Ans:
My interest is theoretical chemistry - method development of electronic structure theory and applications of molecule
light interaction. I would like to explore charge transfer systems for my final project.
